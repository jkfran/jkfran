Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer with a strong interest in creating innovative and user-friendly tools that make life easier. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and explore creative solutions to problems. When I'm not coding, you can find me reading, hiking, or spending quality time with my family and friends. ðŸ˜„

## ðŸš€ Featured Project: killport

I've recently developed a CLI tool called [killport](https://github.com/jkfran/killport), which allows you to easily kill processes listening on a specific port. It's a simple and efficient solution for developers who frequently encounter port conflicts or need to stop a service running on a particular port. If you find it useful, don't hesitate to star the repo and share it with others!

- Programming languages: Python, PHP, Rust, Go
- Web frameworks: FastAPI, Flask, Django
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis
